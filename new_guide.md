# Task: High-End Developer Portfolio Generation

## Persona
Act as a Senior Frontend Engineer and UI/UX Designer specializing in modern, high-performance personal brands. Your goal is to build a single-page portfolio that feels premium, fast, and professional.

## Design Aesthetic: "Modern Minimalist Noir"
* **Color Palette:** Deep Charcoals (#121212), Accents in Electric Indigo or Cyber Lime, and Crisp White typography.
* **Typography:** Use a mix of a bold Sans-Serif (like Inter or Montserrat) for headers and a Mono font for technical details.
* **Vibe:** Subtle glassmorphism, smooth scroll-reveal animations, and "Bento Box" grid layouts for projects.

## Technical Requirements
* **Framework:** Use React with Tailwind CSS (or Lucide-React for icons).
* **Interactivity:** Implement a sticky navigation, a "back to top" button, and hover states for all interactive elements.
* **Responsive:** Mobile-first design; the project grid must collapse elegantly.

## Content Structure
1.  **Hero Section:** * Headline: "Building digital products that scale."
    * Subtext: "Full-stack developer focused on high-performance interfaces."
    * CTA: "View My Work" (Smooth scroll to projects).
2.  **About Me:** A clean two-column layout. Left: A short bio. Right: A "Tech Stack" marquee or grid of chips.
3.  **Project Gallery:** * 3-4 Featured Projects.
    * Each card should have: Image placeholder, Title, Tech tags (e.g., Next.js, TypeScript), and a GitHub link icon.
4.  **Contact:** A minimalist footer with "Let's connect" and social icons (GitHub, LinkedIn, Email).

## Instructions for AI
1.  **Generate the complete code** for a single-file React component (using Tailwind).
2.  **Focus on "Micro-interactions":** Ensure buttons have slight scaling or color shifts on hover.
3.  **Avoid fluff:** Do not add generic filler text; keep the copy punchy and professional.
